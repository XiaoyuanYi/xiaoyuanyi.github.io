    Publications:
      - title: Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper
        authors:
          - Albert Einstein
        publisher: Annalen der Physik
        releaseDate: 1905-06-30
        url: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies
        summary: It concerned an interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the properties of light and time. Special relativity incorporates the principle that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers regardless of the state of motion of the source.

      - title: Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt
        authors:
          - Albert Einstein
        publisher: Annalen der Physik
        releaseDate: 1905-03-18
        url: https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Über_einen_die_Erzeugung_und_Verwandlung_des_Lichtes_betreffenden_heuristischen_Gesichtspunkt
        summary: In the second paper, he applied the quantum theory to light to explain the photoelectric effect. In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

      - title: Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie
        authors:
          - Albert Einstein
        publisher: Annalen der Physik

        url: https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_Grundlage_der_allgemeinen_Relativitätstheorie
        summary: The publication of the theory of general relativity made him internationally famous. He was professor of physics at the universities of Zurich (1909–1911) and Prague (1911–1912), before he returned to ETH Zurich (1912–1914).
