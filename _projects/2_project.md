## Project Introduction

Jiuge (九歌) is an interactive Chinese classical poetry generation system that helps users co-create high-quality poems through human–AI collaboration. Instead of only producing a fixed output, Jiuge allows users to provide themes or keywords, choose poetic forms, revise lines they dislike, and let the system regenerate candidates in real time, making composition flexible, controllable, and creative. As one of the earliest generative AI systems developed in China, Jiuge has been used tens of millions of times by users from over one hundred countries and regions. It received the Best System Demonstration Award at the China National Conference on Computational Linguistics, as well as the Tencent Exploratory Innovation Technology Application Award, and has been featured multiple times on China Central Television (CCTV).
